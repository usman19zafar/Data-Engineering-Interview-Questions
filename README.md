What data engineering is REALLY about
Here’s the real scope, in your two‑word logic style:

1. Ingest data
From CSV, JSON, APIs, databases, streams.

2. Validate schema
Your current exercise.

3. Enforce quality
Null checks, type checks, constraints, expectations.

4. Transform data
Bronze → Silver → Gold
Raw → Clean → Business‑ready.

5. Model data
Dimensions, facts, star schemas, aggregates.

6. Optimize storage
Partitioning, Z‑ordering, Delta Lake, caching.

7. Orchestrate pipelines
Scheduling, retries, dependencies, monitoring.

8. Govern data
Lineage, cataloging, access control, auditability.

9. Serve data
Power BI, APIs, ML models, dashboards.

If you know the implication and working of all these steps you have good knowledge base!

11. Ensure reliability
SLAs, SLIs, SLOs, fail‑fast behavior, alerts.
